            Use workaround to kill <code>document.referrer</code> bug. Workaround: cancel all requests and make freshnew ones when cross domain, like directly hit (currently only implemented for GET method, other methods remain as is)

                (Don't check this is you don't enable above workaround) Don't handle in-page resources to reduce CPU consumption. (If you have above workaround enabled, and your Firefox 's <code>network.http.referer.trimmingPolicy = 2</code>, no in-page requests handling is 98% the same as do handling)
